This experiment asks the user a math question and waits until a correct response is provided
Aisha Ahmad

This experiment asks the user addition questions and then waits for them to respond (enter numbers then click enter when they're done entering their answer). The users response and response time will be recorded. Irregardless if the user gets the question right or not they will progress to the next question.

The stimuli are mathematical questions and they are presented indefinitely until the user inputs an answer.

The participant enters their answer to the mathematical question and clicks enter.

I record all responses, as well as accuracy, alongside correct responses and response time.

I save the file as a csv file with headers and the rows representing the saved data from each trial.
